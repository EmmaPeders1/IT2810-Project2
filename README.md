## :page_with_curl: Content and functionality

### Content

When starting the application, the user will be met by a header and a search field. The user can input their desired URL-link and accesstoken. If at least one of the inputs are not accepted, an error message will appear when trying to access the data by pressing one of the buttons. These reads *USERS*, *COMMITS* and *ISSUES*. Upon clicking on the different buttons, a data grid will be visible for the user. This data grid will have different headers based on what button is pressed. The user can filter or sort these as they like. 


###  Functionality

To adhere to responsive web design, the elements are are responsive to changes and are functional for different screen sizes. This is primarly implemented by the use of flex boxes. 

The saving on this website is automatic and the user will be met by their old choice of theme and API upon restart. The saving is handled by **[INSERT REASON]**

The gitlab-data is parametric as the user has the ability to change what the data grids are displaying. All the columns has a filter property which can be accessed by pressing the three vertical dots which appear within the header cell upon hovering. The same process can be used to obtain the ability to decide how the data is sorted and what data to display. The last feature can be problematic, as the user can remove all the columns, but this can be undone by changing to a different category and then choosing the old category again. This means that the user's choices concerning the data grid does not last, even in session. 

## :wrench: Technical requirements

The project is based p친 Node and use of the Node Package Manager (NPM). Version 16.X of node.js and version 8.X of npm.

We used the command create-react-app xxx --template typescript to set up the project and are using version 18.

Our application is therefore implemented with TypeScript and is based on React (and JSX). Functional components are primarly used, but the *Header.tsx* and *Footer.tsx*- files are class based components. The component structure is appropriate to the project, as the components- and css-files are placed in folders by the same names. 

*State* and *props* are used to save and change the appearance of the application. 

The Context API is used to **[NOE MED URL]**.

The data grids which are returned in *UserFetcher.tsx*, *CommitFetcher.tsx* and *IssueFetcher.tsx* are imported from [mui.com](https://mui.com/) and modified for our project. *Input.tsx*, *Button.tsx*, *Footer.tsx*, *Header.tsx* and the wrapper classes made up by these are self made.  

The data from Gitlab is fetched with the fetch() function. (mer om dette og AJAX??)

HTML Web Storage is used to save the state of theme and input in the fields. In order to save the theme, and have the application remember chosen theme the next time an user starts the server,  we have utilized local storage by creating a custom react hook useLocalStorage(key, defaultValue) to store the state. 
To make use of session storage, we have made it possible to store the input from the user for each session. Every time the user types in the input field for URL or accesstoken and refreshes the window/ opens a new window, the input is saved.

Our solution has a responsive web design. Layout, scaling and interaction posibilities are adaptable based on what type of device and screen size. By using flex boxes, all the elements and their contents are visible and available for the user to see and interact with.  

**F칮lgende elementer skal v칝re med i l칮sningen (eventuelt begrunnet i dokumentasjonen hvis det ikke er tatt med)**
*    Viewport
*    Media-queries
*    Bilder som skalerer
*    Flytende/fleksibel layout

Our solution includes Viewport **[REALLY?]** by ...?
Media-queries and picture scaling are used in the Header. 

# :gear: Testing

Prosjektet skal vise oppsett av og eksempel p친 testing med Jest - minimum er 친 ha en snapshottest og noen enkle tester p친 komponentenes oppf칮rsel. 

M친let med dette kravet er at dere kommer i gang med testing, f친r erfaring i oppsett og en forst친else av hva vi typisk tester i React-applikasjoner. Vi legger lite vekt p친 omfanget av testingen, men dere skal vise at dere har forst친tt prinsippet i testingen.

Testing av brukergrensesnitt og responsiv design: Gruppa skal beskrive/dokumentere testing p친 minimum 3 forskjellige enheter hvor det m친 inng친 en mobil (liten skjerm/horisontal + vertikal orientering og en ordin칝r pc (stor skjerm). 

In testing the user interface and responsive design, we have used the device emulation in the web browser to simulate the design of the appilcation on a phone screen (vertically and horizontally) and an ordinary PC (big screen).

# :gear: In retrospective

In retrospective, we have gained experience and have some thoughts on what we could have done better. 

For example, we realized that we should have structured our fetching of data and components in another way. Right now we have 3 different components responsible for fetching their own data (User-, Commit- and IssueFetcher). This is nto a good solution. For example thecode in these components responsible for fetching is very similar. If we had more time, we would have written a custom hook for fecthing. Also, we would let another component do ALL the fetching, and the have these components only display the data based on user selection. This way it would be also be easier to validate the url-link and access token provided by the user. Then, we would only display the buttons if an existing gitlab-project with a valid token was provided, otherwise we would alert the user that their input is invalid. Right now, a new call to the API is done everytime a user selects "Users", "Commits" or "Issues". This is quite inneficient and would also be avoided with this other method.
